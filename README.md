# SwingX (SwingSet3)

This repository contains a copy of the source code for the SwingX library. The code was downloaded and salvaged
from the SwingX development SVN repository on [java.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java.net)
before Oracle acquired Sun and took that site offline permanently. The code is therefore more recent
than any released version of SwingX by [SwingLabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwingLabs). The last jar published was version 1.6.5-1 dated Feb 27 2013, see tags on [ebourg/swingx](https://github.com/ebourg/swingx).

- the last [commit](https://github.com/homebeaver/SwingSet3/commit/820656cece5d727e85c32f335a3363bc852d07d8) by user "kleopatra" was made at 17:59:46, October 09, 2013.

### post SwingLabs forks

[Softec AG fork](https://github.com/Softec-Open-Source-Division/swingx) made updates to [v1.6.6](https://github.com/Softec-Open-Source-Division/swingx/releases/tag/v1.6.6) without publishing a jar

**This SwingSet3 fork** continues the work with [v1.6.6-1 jar](https://github.com/homebeaver/SwingSet3/releases/tag/v1.6.6-1) build for Java 8

The goal of this fork is a SwingSet3 jar [v1.6.7](https://github.com/homebeaver/SwingSet3/releases/tag/v1.6.7), ... [v1.7.4](https://github.com/homebeaver/SwingSet3/releases/tag/v1.7.4)+ for [OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK), (Adoptium or Temurin)

### Screenshots

- see [SwingSet3-demos](https://github.com/homebeaver/SwingSet3-demos) demonstrating
